        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At EdGenAI, our mission is to transform education by making generative AI tools transparent,
          equitable, and aligned with authentic learning outcomes. We believe AI should augment and not
          replace the educator’s role, empowering teachers to deliver deeper, more meaningful learning experiences.

        <h2>How We Work</h2>
        <p>
          We collaborate with educators, instructional designers, and institutions to co-create AI solutions that
          align with their specific pedagogical goals. Every feature we build is informed by academic feedback,
          pilot-tested in real classrooms, and continuously improved based on educator insights. Our agile,
          modular approach ensures our tools integrate seamlessly into diverse teaching environments.

        <h2>Our AI Principles</h2>
        <p>
          We’re committed to building AI responsibly. Our systems are guided by three principles:
          <strong> Transparency</strong> — clear explanations of how outputs are generated;
          <strong> Modularity</strong> — tools that adapt to your curriculum; and
          <strong> Privacy</strong> — robust protections for student and institutional data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all, we prioritize the integrity of the learning process. We design AI not to shortcut thinking,
          but to support critical reasoning, scaffold reflection, and enhance feedback—at scale.
